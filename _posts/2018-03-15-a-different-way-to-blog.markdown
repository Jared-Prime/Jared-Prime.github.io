preview: something that's worked well for me lately - fuga hacia adelante
---

I used to overplan blog posts or pressure myself on the quality of the post. Reviving my blogging -- and quitting Twitter -- I've allowed myself to write shorter, more exploratory posts. My idea is to get the ideas out there, se where my mind leads, and I've taken heart from Argentinian novelist Cesar Aira's _fuga hacia adelante_ ("the flight forward") allowing myself to get words on the page quickly. It's almost as if I'm in actual conversation.

In any case, I've started writing more, and writing more quickly, giving an opportunity to explore, toss aside ideas, and just see what works for me. And its fun. We'll see how it lasts.
