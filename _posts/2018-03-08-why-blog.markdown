Happy [International Women's Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com)!

I sometimes get caught up in feeling like blog posts, or social media posts of any kind, need to be some kind of well-crafted literary gem. That needn't be the case.

In blogging, or in social media posts of any kind, we've all started to learn that obsfucation, coarseness, and extreme distrust are all very real, and very problematic outcomes in the worst-case-scenarios of online communication. One recourse, which I have done by quitting Twitter altogether, is to leave the scene.

Yet blogs are more than the echo chamber of social media platforms. There's quite a bit of agency and choice for both readers and writers of blogs. That's why I'm stating my intention in continuing to blog. As a blogger, I will aim to

- ensure visibility of my ideas and actions in the world
- practice refinement of my ideas in concert with others' feedback
- establish trust with people that I meet online and in real life

It's a simple statement, yet difficult to achieve, and I think one I'm well-capable of achieving. Thanks for reading.
