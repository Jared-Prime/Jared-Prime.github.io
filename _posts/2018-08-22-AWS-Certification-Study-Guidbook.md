I am writing this guidebook to help me study for the AWS Certified Developer Associate and AWS Certified DevOps Professional exams. I chose to write a study guide for a simple reason: preparing this guide will help me pass the examination test. I have viewed multiple hours of video courses, taken multiple practice exams, read many pages of documentation, and experimented with the AWS console and command line tools; however I know my learning habits well-enough that writing a guidebook usually helps me learn best.

Check out my guidebook at [https://aws-certification-study-guide.jared-pri.me](aws-certification-study-guide.jared-pri.me). Feel free to leave feedback on the contents.
