## problem: overly detailed planning

We might ask ourselves, "what if we had a good plan in place and followed that?" The problem, then, may be that the plan supplants the process itself. The plan only ever reflects the desired progress and never tracks actuals.

> This practice gives management a "comfortable view" of delivery before the project starts. However, when the plan is never tracked against, nor updated, it becomes increasingly inaccurate as the project progresses.

In reality, management reserves the ability to intervene and place a project on a new track towards completion. This means accepting the project plan as a changeable internal product in and of itself.

> Sometimes, when a project plan created prior to project launch, management assumes that the plan guarantees delivery automaticallyâ€”exactly as specified with no intervention (or management) necessary.

## solution: criteria for project plans

Start by at least defining the scope of the plan and its deliverables. This involves splitting the work output appropriately by type.

> A project plan should show primarily deliverables (regardless of how many teams are working on the project). Deliverables should be identified at two levels:
> 1. Product(s). Those artifacts sold to a customer, which include the internal corporate lines of business that use them.
> 2. Components (within products). Basic technology artifacts required to support a business service.

And, of course, even the best plans may have been laid to waste

> Tracking is done on the estimated level of completeness. This sometimes means regressing the completeness that was input to the plan in a previous time period. Completeness should be gross measurements rather than fine measurements, for example, tracking in 25 percent steps rather than 5 percent steps.
