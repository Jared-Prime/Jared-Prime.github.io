I wanted to know what it takes to be a good project manager. I see value in having a project manager on my team and in fostering the skill set in my own workplace behaviors. To get started, I skimmed the top 5 search hits on "project management skills" and cross-referenced them to generate a "meta-list".

Here's the categories that get 3 or more mentions.

1. Leadership (5 out of 5 articles)
3. Communication (4 out of 5 articles)
3. Teamwork (4 out of 5 articles)
4. Time Management (4 out of 5 articles)
5. Analysis (3 out of 5)
6. Budgeting (3 out of 5)
7. Risk Management (3 out of 5)

That feels like a decent sample. [Here's my data collection](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fiy3lSivOuaLVuRdJV4u9LOkEg6zBlh35Zl3fx9r1r8/edit?usp=sharing), including relabeling notes and links to original sources. I feel like additional sources + relabeling will end up with a very similar list of 7 as above. Next steps -- since I am not looking for a fully scientific review of the required skillsets -- will be to get a decent handle on what each of those seven skills means in terms of project management. The end goal, when I get there, will be to try and improve my own skills following suggested guidelines and resources.
