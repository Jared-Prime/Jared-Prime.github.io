preview: Learning a language or a tool isn't just about gaining new skills
---

Ruby is my first programming language, with JavaScript nearly contemporaneous for me. I first studied and began using SQL, HTML, and CSS around the same time, in 2012. This collection of "first langauges" make me, under some criteria, a "full stack" developer for the web -- although I'll dispute that label if pressed on it.

Looking at my career in the +5 years since summer 2012, I have studied and/or used C, Go, Haskell, and Scala to various degrees. This collection of "second languages" make me, under some other criteria, a "backend" developer for the web. This label seems closer to my actual work, but I'd dispute it, too, on the basis that I feel much freer from "the web" in using those languages than, say, Ruby and JavaScript.

_Before_ my career in software, I studied and used the languages of mathematics, formal logic, and academic English. This collection of "early languages" make me, under other similar criteria, simply just an intelligent person -- I dispute this label as well.

Why did I learn these things if not to signal that I'm intelligent or a full-stack developer or a backend programmer? Well, signalling _was_ (and still is) a major aspect in choosing to learn certain ways of expressing ideas. I simply would not self-ascribe those specific choices in language as an attempt to send a specific signal to others. When I think back, here are my reasons:

- I can express an idea in one language (eg. Haskell) that is otherwise more difficult (eg. Ruby) or impossible (eg. CSS) to express
- I have more tools at hand in one language (eg. Ruby) that I wouldn't have otherwise (eg. C)
- I feel more productive in one language (eg. Go) than in another (eg. JavaScript)
- I gain more rewards ($) in one language (eg. SQL) than in another (eg. formal logic)

Then there are second-hand reasons to choose a language:

- the other users are nice (eg. Ruby)
- the other users are smart (eg. Haskell)
- the other users are wise (eg. C)
- the other users are ambitious (eg. Go, Scala)
- the other users are everywhere (eg. JavaScript)

Those reasons, of course, aren't mutually exclusive for the examples given.

And sometimes there's purely aesthetic reasons, such as how the semantics look or how the toolchain APIs feel.

All this, taken together, makes me think of the prevalance of "flame wars" when it comes to language comparisons: one developer says to another that they'd like to learn a specific language then the other responds with either incredulidity or a deluge of reasons why they shouldn't learn it. There's no good outcome in such a discussion. I think it's good enough for somebody to say that they're interested and have that interest be the self-evident rationale for learning. Interlocutors should support even the thinnest reasons for learning and seek to, however they can, learn from others' learning. Perhaps there's some relatively arcane rationale for picking up a language (eg. kdb+ and vector processing). You might find something valuable there, even if it's just curiosity.
