preview: reviving my blog with new writing goals for the fall
---

Since writing takes dedication and focus, I hope to help myself write more by establishing some simple goals.

1. Set aside time to write every day. 15-30 minutes should be fine; just make sure I have enough time to get a coherent, digestible (for the reader) thought conveyed. If I allow any more time, distrations become probable.
2. Keep a log of topics to write on. Right now, I'm using a [public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/06AirknX/writing-topics) to track topics. I want this board public to hold myself accountable. I also want to be open to "accountability buddies" providing feedback on the board.
3. Publish in various media. This blog will be the central repository of my entries, but I also want to distribute articles across targeted outlets: eg. LinkedIn, Medium, Twitter. Again, the goal is to get feedback moreso than recognition.

That's it for now. I will be refining my approach as I continue, and I thank you very much for following along.
