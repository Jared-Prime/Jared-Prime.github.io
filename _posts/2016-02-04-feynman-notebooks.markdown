preview: an effective learning strategy based on a Richard Feynman anecdote
---

I want to disclaim two things: First, is my feeling that secondary and tertiary literature on Richard Feynman and his work borders on hagiography and dogma. Feynman resembles a philosopher in this literature; he, like Aristotle, is expounded upon for his ideas with surprisingly little effort from the author to replicate experiments or confirm the theories behind them. Secondly, I am essentially contributing to this body of literature by expounding upon an anecdote about Feynman’s learning habits. By saying that the habits revealed by this anecdote are “effective”, I mean that I feel, at this time, for me, these habits have what seems to be a positive impact on my learning. Read into those clauses and tenses what you may.

I first heard of this learning strategy from a [blog post by Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/11/25/the-feynman-notebook-method/), who in turn learned of it through the Feynman biography by James Glieck (hence my disclaimer about secondary and tertiary sources of information). The method is simple:

1. dedicate a notebook to “things I do not know"
2. on the first page, write a list of things you do not know
3. as you find the answer to each item, write a page detailing the answer and sources for the answer
4. next to the question, write the page of the answer
5. add any follow-up questions to the list of things you do not know

Newport says the notebook "can provide concrete cues that help you stick with this hard process [of learning unfamiliar things]” and will help you "translate your growing knowledge of something hard into a concrete form and you’re more likely to keep investing the mental energy needed to keep learning."

Let’s dissect this a bit. He highlights:

- a learning process
- concrete cues to maintain the learning process
- concrete form for representing gained knowledge
- improved investment for learning

I have found the Feynman Notebook to help with the second and third. The Feynman Notebook is a process, so the first is given. But is this process really an improvement?
