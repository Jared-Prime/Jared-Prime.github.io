After initial hiccups in the PDF distribution, I've finally obtained and downloaded a PDF copy of [_Distributed Systems_](https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/distributed-systems-3rd-edition-2017/). As motivation to read and [understand](https://www.drmaciver.com/2016/05/how-to-read-a-mathematics-textbook/) the text, I've started assembling a reading group. It may, due to lack of active recruiting and outreach, end up a group of one -- but last I checked that was more than zero!

I'm [tracking progress via Trello](https://trello.com/b/pZJyRIT2) and [discussing the readings in Gitter](https://gitter.im/jared-prime-github-io/distributed-systems).

While writing blog posts here, I may (due to lazy editing) forget to properly quote phrases from the text, but I will always be sure to link back to the official www.distributed-system.net site. This has to do with how I happen to be taking notes while reading... I'll be sure to quote other sources appropriately.
