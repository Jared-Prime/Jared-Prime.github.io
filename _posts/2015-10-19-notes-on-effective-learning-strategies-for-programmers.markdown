First of all: why am I reading this article? Allison [posted these keynote address notes on Twitter](https://twitter.com/akaptur/status/653282357546385408), but I read a lot of articles on Twitter and do not always take notes on them. So it seems I need to keep a couple things in mind while re-reading for these notes:

- I enjoy reading and thinking, but this does not necessarily accumulate to learning
- the desire that reading and thinking should accumulate to learning may arise from treating knowledge as a kind of capital (a very loose metaphor)
- taking the two together, taking the enthyme brings me to: I need a good strategy to ensure I learn effectively

Sometimes, forgetting or misremembering or failing to understand something one has supposedly learned wounds one’s confidence. And so this article dresses that wound.

Allison, as a a facilitator at the Recurse Center, observed: "There’s almost no structure to the program – no deadlines, no assignments, no teaching. It’s an experiment in unstructured learning for adults.” Much like everyday life, any learning that does occur is highly unstructured (question: What does it mean to be highly unstructured? Is this really different from not having any structure? Or is there some pattern to the way this lack of formality plays out?). The advantage of Recurse Center is that there is a community where similarly unstructured learners empathize with each other, helping each other find a pattern which allows them to learn.

Allison found a way to nudge her mentees towards productive patterns:

- cultivate a growth mindset:
    - "Under a growth mindset, people believe that intelligence is malleable and can increase with effort.”
    - “this framing impacts how people view effort… People who have a growth mindset believe that you need to exert effort and work hard at something to become better at it.” This seems particularly simple and immediately defuses the surprise that comes when you find out how difficult it is to really learn something new
    - "a growth mindset made students more likely to choose a challenge instead of something easy, more likely to persist after a setback, and more honest about their performance, compared to the students with a fixed mindset.” I’m not certain about the strict likelihood of the effect (how likely? compared to how many alternatives? what’s the qualitative effect of a decile change in this likelihood? quartile change? etc). But, again, the enthyme brings one to a place where they may receive praise, criticism, and challenges with less resistance (again: how to measure resistance to social context?)
- reframe praise and success
    - "when you get the wrong kind of compliments, turn them into growth-mindset compliments” This is a nice technique; at the very least, it’s a very honest response that encourages others to follow specific steps to a particular success. In other words, rephrasing praise in this manner helps make success reproducible.
- reframe failure
    - "ask what you learned from your unsuccessful attempt or what strategies you could have used instead” Again, this is not only honest but also targets specific corrections that make failure avoidable
- celebrate challenges
    - "emphasized to the participant that finding something where they struggled an accomplishment, it was intentional, and it was a good thing for them to have done that day” Here’s a difficult one; it requires sidestepping the emotional response to the challenge first before placing oneself back into the “growth mindset.” Once there, however, one’s done two things: (1) highlighted the precise difficulties; (2) reviewed or reached out for help on how to overcome those difficulties; (3) turned the challenge into actual learning!
- ask about processes
    - "be really disciplined about asking how they did it” Mileage may vary depending on who “they” are; at the very least, I would tend to believe that, at the very least, you would begin to identify teacher and teaching strategies that are commensurate with your learning, and thereby more effective

There is much more detail and discussion in Allison’s article; please do [visit her original post](http://akaptur.com/blog/2015/10/10/effective-learning-strategies-for-programmers/) to learn more. I certainly plan to revisit and digest more.
