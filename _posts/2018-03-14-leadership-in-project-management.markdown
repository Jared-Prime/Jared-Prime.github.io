preview: Many seem to agree that good project managers exhibit leadership. What does this mean?

In ["What do people say about project management?"](http://jared-pri.me/2018/03/12/what-do-people-say-about-project-management/), I found that I felt more likely to find articles about project management skills that mentioned "leadership" as any other skill set. Drawing back on my sources from earlier, what do they have to say about leadership as it relates to good project management?

One article gives no specifics; instead, it hotlinks to its own resources on leadership, which in turn appear to repeat many of the same points about good project management in general (eg. time management, organization, etc.). The others did give some good specifics about what they think makes for good leadership. In summary, a project manager is able to:

- motivate people who do not work directly for them
- keep teams working effectively together
- seem likeable even as they are being assertive
- select the right people to perform the right task
- handle change with grace
- handle issues (eg. "problems") following a recognized process
- involve other people when and where they're needed
- stay positive

These seem reasonable. I'd certainly consider someone who's skilled in these ways a leader. What do you think?
