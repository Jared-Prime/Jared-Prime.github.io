*lack of focus*

I've missed the deadlines for my 1UP project. No worries, what I have done for the project has been successful; moreso than I thought possible. My quickstudy of grep, for example, allowed me to answer a colleague's question about the program without thinking twice about the answer!

So, where do I go from here? Let's do this New Years style:

1. Keep off Twitter. Or, at least, stop reading the feed. I find Twitter most useful when someone shares a link to interesting content. Discussions over Twitter are useless. One-off-comments on Twitter are worse than useless. So just lay off the feed, and use the share button only.
2. Stay tuned to rss feeds. The most useful resources are well-maintained blogs, and these are best followed via rss. It doesn't even matter if I read all the post so long as I...
3. Utilize Pocket.app. Pocket is a wonderful application for saving, sharing, and sorting articles. It's basically just a bookmarking application, but a nicely built one at that.
4. Go for the long haul. You can find on my reading now shelf many *very* difficult texts. That's ok so long as I recognize these books are intended to contribute to long-term learning and skill development.
5. Talk to everybody. I'm looking forward to reconnecting to a number of people who have experience in mathematics, programming, and in business. These people are the most valuable resources I've got, so I best make use of them!
