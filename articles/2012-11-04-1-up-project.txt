[Joe Nelson introduced his 1UP project](http://1up.begriffs.com/ "1UP") this summer. As Joe introduced it, 1UP project is undertaken to "become a world class developer" through "purpose, focus, and vulnerability."

I've admired Joe's work, and so I've decided to follow his example. Short on time, however, I'm modifying the scope of my personal 1UP challenge:

- Purpose: my 1UP project won't turn me into a world-class developer in the short space of a year, but it can bring advanced tools and techniques well within grasp. Hence, I will strive to know what I have not yet learned so that I may work to acquire that knowledge in the not-too-distant future.
- Focus: during my 1UP project, each challenge will be self-contained, designed specifically to achieve a simple task. This is the key to my 1UP project, and I have a few initial ideas listed below.
- Vulnerability: the most fearsome thing is to ask questions, especially of persons much more knowledgeable and skilled than yourself. Hence, following the inspiration of another admired developer, [Iris Classon](http://www.irisclasson.com/category/365-stupid-questions/ "365 Stupid Questions"), I'll pose each challenge in the form of a question and seek feedback on my proposed answers.

Here are some topics that may engender appropriate challenges:

- studying common and not-so-common Unix commands, and their use during development
- using rake to increase efficiency in performing application maintenance
- writing, extending, and utilizing modules in Ruby
- building fast, unobtrusive JavaScript to enhance user experience
